    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "1. Structured output validates the provided response, and ensures it comes in a way that we expect. LLM output, especially Agentic output, can be used in a variety of ways by other agents or later parts of the pipeline. \n",
    "2. In the provided example, we want our agent to provide us with a list of search queries. If we use that list in the pipeline to do search queries, we need to ensure we can a) differentiate between queries (where one finishes, and another starts, otherwise we may interpret it as a single query) and b) avoid writing hard-to-maintain parsing functions E.g., we can simply prompt the model to provide us a with search queries separating them by new line, write a custom function to parse it to a list, and then continue working with this as a list. But why do it? It creates a need to maintain a custom function, doesn't guarantee we'll get expected output for whatever reason (which is more often with simple models), and introduces overheads for engineers to understand how system works. Instead, we simply pass expected type of output next in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional example: in a more complex solutions it becomes critical. I have an AI Public Speaking Coach, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation of your response, including a variety of scores, etc.. While I can simply prompt to provide a json output, I'm at a mercy of LLM to do that, while also needing to parse that output myself and write multiple validating functions. It makes the code hard to maintain and unnecessarily complex."

      "Report: # Report on Limitations and Considerations for Telehealth Providers of Behavioral Health Services in New York State\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapid expansion of telehealth services has reshaped the delivery of behavioral health care, offering both increased access and new challenges. This report explores the key limitations and considerations for telehealth providers offering behavioral health services in New York State. As telehealth becomes an increasingly vital component of mental health and substance use treatment, providers must navigate a complex landscape of federal and state regulations. This report aims to inform compliance officers and behavioral health executives about the critical requirements and pitfalls in ensuring that their telehealth practices align with both legal and regulatory obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Regulatory Framework Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Telehealth services in the behavioral health domain are subject to a multifaceted regulatory framework. The federal and state laws intersect in several ways, resulting in specific obligations relating to licensure, patient consent, privacy, and reimbursement. Where federal statutes (e.g., HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, MHPAEA, ACA) set the baseline standards, state-specific regulations, particularly those developed by the New York State Education Department’s Office of the Professions and the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH), shape the operational details. These state rules address several key areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Licensure and Credentialing:** Practitioners must hold valid New York licenses to deliver behavioral health services remotely, regardless of their physical location during the telehealth session (New York State Education Department, op.nysed.gov).\n",
      "- **Medicaid Reimbursement:** Providers must comply with Medicaid requirements, including registration in New York State Medicaid programs and adhering to guidelines for service documentation (New York State Department of Health, health.ny.gov).\n",
      "- **Privacy, Security, and Consent:** Telehealth interactions must meet HIPAA and NY HIPA standards for protecting patient information, including protocols for informed consent, secure data transmission, and electronic record management.\n",
      "- **Prescribing Controlled Substances:** New York and federal guidelines impose specific requirements for prescribing medications remotely through telehealth, often necessitating prior in-person evaluations under defined circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Federal Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal law forms the bedrock of privacy, data security, and the appropriate use of telehealth in healthcare. Key federal considerations include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** HIPAA sets rigorous standards for protecting patient health information and requires that telehealth platforms ensure data security and privacy. Providers must implement technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, especially during the electronic transmission of sensitive behavioral health data (HIPAA, 45 CFR Parts 160/164).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **42 CFR Part 2:** For substance use treatment programs, this regulation limits disclosures of patient records that contain sensitive information. Any telehealth platform used to deliver behavioral health services in areas such as substance abuse must strictly adhere to these confidentiality standards (42 CFR Part 2, SAMHSA, recent guidance).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **DEA Guidelines:** With respect to the prescription of controlled substances via telehealth, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has extended flexibilities, although New York State rules may at times impose stricter provincial parameters such as a mandatory in-person evaluation with specific exceptions (DEA/HHS, telehealth prescribing guidelines, 2025).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. New York State Regulatory Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.1 Licensure and Credentialing\n",
      "\n",
      "In New York, the Department of Education’s Office of the Professions is the primary licensing authority. Telehealth providers must:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hold a valid New York State license or equivalent authorization to practice in New York. This applies irrespective of the provider’s location when delivering care to patients within the state (op.nysed.gov).\n",
      "- Obtain New York-specific licensure for practitioners practicing from out-of-state. This necessitates not only holding the appropriate credentials but also complying with New York’s telepractice guidelines (OMH, 14 NYCRR Part 596).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Medicaid Reimbursement and Payment Parity\n",
      "\n",
      "New York requires telehealth practitioners to be fully enrolled in the New York State Medicaid program. Compliance includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Registering with the Medicaid program and adhering to its billing and documentation practices, including accurately recording the patient’s physical location during each session (health.ny.gov).\n",
      "- Following network adequacy and payment parity regulations. For example, regulations effective from July 2025 mandate that initial outpatient behavioral health appointments be accessible within designated business day limits. This ensures that both telehealth and in-person services are reimbursed at aligned rates, promoting access and continuity of care (governor.ny.gov, DFS press releases).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.3 Privacy, Informed Consent, and Confidentiality\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy and confidentiality remain paramount in behavioral health telemedicine. In New York, providers must:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Secure informed consent either by written documentation or detailed electronic notes. The consent process must explain the benefits and risks of telehealth, the modalities used (video, audio-only, etc.), and patient rights regarding withdrawal of consent (casetext.com).\n",
      "- Ensure that both the telehealth platform and the practices around data storage comply with HIPAA, as well as New York’s recent legislative measures such as the NY Health Information Privacy Act (NY HIPA) (health.ny.gov; wilmerhale.com).\n",
      "- Use encrypted connections and secure servers to minimize risks of data breaches or unauthorized access during telehealth sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.4 Controlled Substances and Prescribing\n",
      "\n",
      "New York State imposes additional constraints on the telehealth prescription of controlled substances:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Providers must conduct an in-person medical evaluation, with narrowly defined exceptions when telehealth prescribing is permissible. These exceptions include situations where the patient has had a recent in-person evaluation, emergency cases, or temporary coverage scenarios (NYSDOH, nixonpeabody.com).\n",
      "- Practitioners prescribing medications must adhere to guidelines including checking the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) Registry and complying with DEA regulations. Telehealth prescribing must mirror the quality and safety standards of in-person care.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.5 Supervision and Training Requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "For certain professionals such as Licensed Master Social Workers (LMSWs) and Licensed Mental Health Counselors (LMHCs), supervision takes on added significance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Supervision is required to ensure that newer practitioners meet the clinical standards of New York State. This includes specified hours of supervised practice, which can be conducted remotely under secure telehealth conditions (naswnys.org; op.nysed.gov).\n",
      "- Continuing education (CE) requirements remain in full force. Providers must actively participate in recertification activities and CE programs, including specialized training for telehealth delivery to ensure technological competence and adherence to updated standards (regs.health.ny.gov).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Considerations and Practical Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "While the regulatory guidelines assist in maintaining quality and safety, several practical considerations remain for providers:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.1 Platform and Technical Infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "- Telehealth platforms must be capable of secure, encrypted communications. Providers should invest in solutions that ensure reliability, even in cases of fluctuating bandwidth, especially in rural areas where access may be limited (health.ny.gov).\n",
      "- Contingency planning is crucial. Protocols must be in place to address technical failures, which include backup arrangements and alternate communication methods to prevent service disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.2 Jurisdictional Conflicts and Compliance Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "- There is an ongoing need to reconcile federal standards with state-specific regulations. Providers must remain alert to situations where state “floor versus ceiling” rules come into play. For instance, while federal law may offer certain flexibilities under the telehealth umbrella, New York’s requirements (such as stringent in-person evaluations for controlled substance prescribing) represent a higher standard that must be met.\n",
      "- Non-compliance can result in administrative penalties, loss of licensure, or other legal consequences. Continuous internal audits and training updates are essential measures to mitigate these risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.3 Rural Access and Network Adequacy\n",
      "\n",
      "- Recognizing the critical value of telehealth in rural settings, New York has introduced initiatives like telehealth backpacks and enhanced Medicaid network adequacy requirements to ensure patients receive timely behavioral health interventions. Providers must assess how their service delivery fits into these broader state initiatives.\n",
      "- Providers must also navigate the digital divide by ensuring that patients in low-bandwidth or underserved areas receive adequate support and have access to alternative contact methods when necessary (healthweb-back.health.ny.gov).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Risk Analysis and Enforcement Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6.1 Pre-emption and Conflicts between Federal and State Standards\n",
      "\n",
      "It is imperative that telehealth providers understand the balance between complying with federal laws and meeting New York State’s enhanced regulations. Federal law typically provides a minimum floor, while New York regulations often prescribe additional or more stringent requirements. For instance, the federal telehealth flexibilities for controlled substances under the DEA may be subject to New York’s mandatory in-person evaluation rules unless specific exceptions apply (nixonpeabody.com).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6.2 Common Compliance Pitfalls\n",
      "\n",
      "Compliance failures often arise from:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Inadequate documentation of informed consent and patient locations during telehealth sessions.\n",
      "- Overlooking the nuances of state-specific licensure requirements for out-of-state providers attempting to treat New York residents.\n",
      "- Insufficient technical safeguards, which could expose sensitive behavioral health information to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6.3 Enforcement and Penalties\n",
      "\n",
      "Both state and federal authorities are vigilant in enforcing these standards. Violations may lead to significant financial penalties, revocation of licenses, or civil litigation. In light of heightened enforcement trends, regular internal audits, updated training for staff, and continual monitoring of both federal and state legislative changes are recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Best Practices and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "For telehealth providers in New York offering behavioral health services, the following best practices are recommended:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ensure Full Licensure Compliance:** Verify that all practitioners hold valid New York State licensure and maintain an up-to-date registration with Medicaid programs.\n",
      "- **Strengthen Informed Consent Processes:** Develop robust informed consent protocols, including detailed patient education on telehealth risks, benefits, and alternatives, with clear documentation in the clinical record.\n",
      "- **Upgrade Technical Infrastructure:** Invest in secure, compliant telehealth platforms with redundant systems to manage connectivity issues.\n",
      "- **Implement Rigorous Training:** Facilitate continuing education for all staff focused on telehealth best practices, regulatory updates, and risk management in behavioral health.\n",
      "- **Conduct Regular Audits:** Periodically review protocols, documentation practices, and compliance measures to mitigate penalties and enhance the overall safety and reliability of telehealth services.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 8. Future Developments and Legislative Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "The regulatory landscape governing telehealth services in New York is evolving. Future legislative initiatives may further transform licensure requirements, data privacy rules, or payment parity regulations. Stakeholders should monitor developments such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Legislative Adjustments in NY HIPA:** Evolving privacy regulations may impose new obligations on how providers document and secure patient data.\n",
      "- **Expansion of Telehealth Prescribing Guidelines:** Ongoing discussions at both federal and state levels regarding the telehealth prescription of controlled substances may result in further regulatory amendments.\n",
      "- **State-Specific Innovations in Virtual Care Delivery:** New York’s commitment to increasing telehealth access, especially in rural areas, may lead to additional state-sponsored initiatives focused on infrastructure and reimbursement adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It remains essential that behavioral health executives and compliance teams remain proactive in assessing and updating internal policies in accordance with these future trends. Collaboration with legal advisors and continuous engagement with industry associations, such as the New York State Psychological Association and the Office of Mental Health, can further enhance preparedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 9. Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Telehealth offers transformative potential for improving access to behavioral health services in New York State. However, providers face a complex regulatory landscape that spans federal mandates and state-specific rules. Compliance with licensure standards, Medicaid requirements, privacy protocols, and controlled substance prescribing rules is critical. Additionally, awareness of technical, jurisdictional, and supervisory challenges is essential to mitigate risks and align service delivery with evolving regulatory requirements.\n",
      "\n",

    "- **Licensure and Credentialing:** Practitioners must hold valid New York licenses to deliver behavioral health services remotely, regardless of their physical location during the telehealth session (New York State Education Department, op.nysed.gov).\n",
    "- **Medicaid Reimbursement:** Providers must comply with Medicaid requirements, including registration in New York State Medicaid programs and adhering to guidelines for service documentation (New York State Department of Health, health.ny.gov).\n",
    "- **Privacy, Security, and Consent:** Telehealth interactions must meet HIPAA and NY HIPA standards for protecting patient information, including protocols for informed consent, secure data transmission, and electronic record management.\n",
    "- **Prescribing Controlled Substances:** New York and federal guidelines impose specific requirements for prescribing medications remotely through telehealth, often necessitating prior in-person evaluations under defined circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Federal Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal law forms the bedrock of privacy, data security, and the appropriate use of telehealth in healthcare. Key federal considerations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** HIPAA sets rigorous standards for protecting patient health information and requires that telehealth platforms ensure data security and privacy. Providers must implement technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, especially during the electronic transmission of sensitive behavioral health data (HIPAA, 45 CFR Parts 160/164).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **42 CFR Part 2:** For substance use treatment programs, this regulation limits disclosures of patient records that contain sensitive information. Any telehealth platform used to deliver behavioral health services in areas such as substance abuse must strictly adhere to these confidentiality standards (42 CFR Part 2, SAMHSA, recent guidance).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DEA Guidelines:** With respect to the prescription of controlled substances via telehealth, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has extended flexibilities, although New York State rules may at times impose stricter provincial parameters such as a mandatory in-person evaluation with specific exceptions (DEA/HHS, telehealth prescribing guidelines, 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. New York State Regulatory Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Licensure and Credentialing\n",
    "\n",
    "In New York, the Department of Education’s Office of the Professions is the primary licensing authority. Telehealth providers must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hold a valid New York State license or equivalent authorization to practice in New York. This applies irrespective of the provider’s location when delivering care to patients within the state (op.nysed.gov).\n",
    "- Obtain New York-specific licensure for practitioners practicing from out-of-state. This necessitates not only holding the appropriate credentials but also complying with New York’s telepractice guidelines (OMH, 14 NYCRR Part 596).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Medicaid Reimbursement and Payment Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "New York requires telehealth practitioners to be fully enrolled in the New York State Medicaid program. Compliance includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Registering with the Medicaid program and adhering to its billing and documentation practices, including accurately recording the patient’s physical location during each session (health.ny.gov).\n",
    "- Following network adequacy and payment parity regulations. For example, regulations effective from July 2025 mandate that initial outpatient behavioral health appointments be accessible within designated business day limits. This ensures that both telehealth and in-person services are reimbursed at aligned rates, promoting access and continuity of care (governor.ny.gov, DFS press releases).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Privacy, Informed Consent, and Confidentiality\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy and confidentiality remain paramount in behavioral health telemedicine. In New York, providers must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secure informed consent either by written documentation or detailed electronic notes. The consent process must explain the benefits and risks of telehealth, the modalities used (video, audio-only, etc.), and patient rights regarding withdrawal of consent (casetext.com).\n",
    "- Ensure that both the telehealth platform and the practices around data storage comply with HIPAA, as well as New York’s recent legislative measures such as the NY Health Information Privacy Act (NY HIPA) (health.ny.gov; wilmerhale.com).\n",
    "- Use encrypted connections and secure servers to minimize risks of data breaches or unauthorized access during telehealth sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Controlled Substances and Prescribing\n",
    "\n",
    "New York State imposes additional constraints on the telehealth prescription of controlled substances:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providers must conduct an in-person medical evaluation, with narrowly defined exceptions when telehealth prescribing is permissible. These exceptions include situations where the patient has had a recent in-person evaluation, emergency cases, or temporary coverage scenarios (NYSDOH, nixonpeabody.com).\n",
    "- Practitioners prescribing medications must adhere to guidelines including checking the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) Registry and complying with DEA regulations. Telehealth prescribing must mirror the quality and safety standards of in-person care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Supervision and Training Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain professionals such as Licensed Master Social Workers (LMSWs) and Licensed Mental Health Counselors (LMHCs), supervision takes on added significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervision is required to ensure that newer practitioners meet the clinical standards of New York State. This includes specified hours of supervised practice, which can be conducted remotely under secure telehealth conditions (naswnys.org; op.nysed.gov).\n",
    "- Continuing education (CE) requirements remain in full force. Providers must actively participate in recertification activities and CE programs, including specialized training for telehealth delivery to ensure technological competence and adherence to updated standards (regs.health.ny.gov).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Additional Considerations and Practical Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "While the regulatory guidelines assist in maintaining quality and safety, several practical considerations remain for providers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Platform and Technical Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Telehealth platforms must be capable of secure, encrypted communications. Providers should invest in solutions that ensure reliability, even in cases of fluctuating bandwidth, especially in rural areas where access may be limited (health.ny.gov).\n",
    "- Contingency planning is crucial. Protocols must be in place to address technical failures, which include backup arrangements and alternate communication methods to prevent service disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Jurisdictional Conflicts and Compliance Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an ongoing need to reconcile federal standards with state-specific regulations. Providers must remain alert to situations where state “floor versus ceiling” rules come into play. For instance, while federal law may offer certain flexibilities under the telehealth umbrella, New York’s requirements (such as stringent in-person evaluations for controlled substance prescribing) represent a higher standard that must be met.\n",
    "- Non-compliance can result in administrative penalties, loss of licensure, or other legal consequences. Continuous internal audits and training updates are essential measures to mitigate these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Rural Access and Network Adequacy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recognizing the critical value of telehealth in rural settings, New York has introduced initiatives like telehealth backpacks and enhanced Medicaid network adequacy requirements to ensure patients receive timely behavioral health interventions. Providers must assess how their service delivery fits into these broader state initiatives.\n",
    "- Providers must also navigate the digital divide by ensuring that patients in low-bandwidth or underserved areas receive adequate support and have access to alternative contact methods when necessary (healthweb-back.health.ny.gov).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Risk Analysis and Enforcement Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Pre-emption and Conflicts between Federal and State Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "It is imperative that telehealth providers understand the balance between complying with federal laws and meeting New York State’s enhanced regulations. Federal law typically provides a minimum floor, while New York regulations often prescribe additional or more stringent requirements. For instance, the federal telehealth flexibilities for controlled substances under the DEA may be subject to New York’s mandatory in-person evaluation rules unless specific exceptions apply (nixonpeabody.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Common Compliance Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "Compliance failures often arise from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inadequate documentation of informed consent and patient locations during telehealth sessions.\n",
    "- Overlooking the nuances of state-specific licensure requirements for out-of-state providers attempting to treat New York residents.\n",
    "- Insufficient technical safeguards, which could expose sensitive behavioral health information to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Enforcement and Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "Both state and federal authorities are vigilant in enforcing these standards. Violations may lead to significant financial penalties, revocation of licenses, or civil litigation. In light of heightened enforcement trends, regular internal audits, updated training for staff, and continual monitoring of both federal and state legislative changes are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Best Practices and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "For telehealth providers in New York offering behavioral health services, the following best practices are recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensure Full Licensure Compliance:** Verify that all practitioners hold valid New York State licensure and maintain an up-to-date registration with Medicaid programs.\n",
