    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "1. Structured output validates the provided response, and ensures it comes in a way that we expect. LLM output, especially Agentic output, can be used in a variety of ways by other agents or later parts of the pipeline. \n",
    "2. In the provided example, we want our agent to provide us with a list of search queries. If we use that list in the pipeline to do search queries, we need to ensure we can a) differentiate between queries (where one finishes, and another starts, otherwise we may interpret it as a single query) and b) avoid writing hard-to-maintain parsing functions E.g., we can simply prompt the model to provide us a with search queries separating them by new line, write a custom function to parse it to a list, and then continue working with this as a list. But why do it? It creates a need to maintain a custom function, doesn't guarantee we'll get expected output for whatever reason (which is more often with simple models), and introduces overheads for engineers to understand how system works. Instead, we simply pass expected type of output next in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional example: in a more complex solutions it becomes critical. I have an AI Public Speaking Coach, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation of your response, including a variety of scores, etc.. While I can simply prompt to provide a json output, I'm at a mercy of LLM to do that, while also needing to parse that output myself and write multiple validating functions. It makes the code hard to maintain and unnecessarily complex."

      "## Full Report\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Regulatory Framework and Policy Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Telehealth in New York State is governed by a complex matrix of federal and state regulations, designed to ensure safe, secure, and efficient delivery of healthcare services. At the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets the benchmark for privacy and security of patient information during electronic communications (HIPAA, 45 CFR Parts 160/164, 2003). In addition, the Ryan Haight Act and the DEA’s evolving telemedicine policies dictate requirements for the prescription of controlled substances in telehealth contexts. Furthermore, specialized rules such as 42 CFR Part 2 protect the confidentiality of substance use disorder treatment records.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the state level, New York has tailored these requirements to accommodate the nuances of behavioral health delivery. New York State Medicaid provides explicit guidelines for telehealth services, including the acceptance of both audio-visual and audio-only modalities when appropriate (health.ny.gov, 2023). The Office of Mental Health (OMH) further requires that providers obtain written approval and submit detailed plans prior to delivering telehealth services, ensuring that confidentiality, medical appropriateness, and informed consent are maintained (omh.ny.gov, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, recent initiatives by Governor Hochul anticipate improvements in behavioral health access by mandating that health insurance plans offer outpatient behavioral health appointments within 10 business days, while also requiring accurate, up-to-date directories of in-network telehealth providers (governor.ny.gov, 2025). Such measures underscore the commitment to not only modernizing service delivery but also safeguarding patient rights and provider responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Telehealth Modalities in Behavioral Health\n",
      "\n",
      "The regulation of tele-behavioral health in New York distinguishes between several service modalities: \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Audio-Visual Services:** These are the preferred platforms for delivering robust, interactive care. Providers are expected to leverage video conferencing technologies that ensure real-time communication and visual assessment when necessary. Synergy between patient and provider is crucial, particularly in mental health settings, where non-verbal cues play a significant role.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Audio-Only Services:** Recognizing the barriers faced by some patients, New York supports the use of audio-only modalities. However, this option is strictly available under circumstances where audio-visual services are unavailable or where patient preference dictates. Providers must document the rationale behind opting for audio-only services, ensuring that clinical appropriateness is maintained (omh.ny.gov, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Documentation and Consent:** Regardless of the modality, obtaining informed consent is a critical component. Providers must thoroughly explain the benefits, limitations, and potential risks associated with telehealth services, while documenting consent in the patient’s medical records. This measure not only complies with legal requirements but also reinforces patient engagement and trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Federal and State Compliance Requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "#### A. Privacy and Security Standards\n",
      "\n",
      "HIPAA remains the cornerstone of privacy protection in telehealth communications. All telehealth platforms used in New York must comply with HIPAA’s guidelines to ensure the secure storage and transmission of patient data (telehealth.hhs.gov, 2020). Additionally, the forthcoming New York Health Information Privacy Act (NY HIPA) is designed to impose even stricter controls over digital health data, including explicit consent mechanisms for the processing of health information (foley.com, 2025).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### B. Licensing and Scope of Practice\n",
      "\n",
      "A significant limitation in tele-behavioral health services is the necessity for providers to be licensed in New York. This requirement applies to both in-state and out-of-state practitioners providing care remotely. Out-of-state providers seeking to offer telehealth services must obtain a New York license, highlighting a barrier to increasing provider networks and enhancing access (op.nysed.gov, 2025).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### C. Controlled Substances and Telehealth\n",
      "\n",
      "The prescription of controlled substances via telehealth poses another layer of regulatory complexity. New York State has, under regulated circumstances, permitted the prescription of controlled substances via telemedicine, contingent upon meeting specific criteria such as recent in-person evaluations or emergency exceptions (nixonpeabody.com, 2025). Providers must adhere to both NYSDOH guidelines and federal DEA rules to navigate this area without incurring compliance risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Practical Considerations and Common Pitfalls\n",
      "\n",
      "#### A. Technological Barriers\n",
      "\n",
      "The adoption of telehealth is not uniform across New York. In rural areas, limited broadband access, inadequate digital literacy, and the unavailability of necessary devices pose significant challenges. These technological hurdles contribute to disparities in access to tele-behavioral health services and require targeted policy interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### B. Reimbursement and Insurance Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "Another practical consideration involves reimbursement policies. Medicaid in New York covers telehealth services under specific conditions. However, discrepancies remain among private insurers regarding coverage for tele-behavioral services. The New York State Department of Financial Services provides guidance to navigate insurance variability, but providers must remain alert to potential delays or denials in reimbursement if documentation and service criteria are not strictly followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### C. Provider Workflows and Liability\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrating telehealth into established clinical workflows can disrupt traditional practices. Providers often cite concerns over maintaining therapeutic rapport, managing technical failures, and ensuring that telehealth sessions meet the standards of in-person care. Additionally, the administrative burden of documenting rationales for telehealth use—including exceptions for certain modalities—can lead to errors if not meticulously managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Risk Analysis and Enforcement Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "#### A. Interplay of Federal and State Rules\n",
      "\n",
      "A central challenge in the tele-behavioral healthcare realm is the intersection of federal and state regulations. Issues such as pre-emption, the “floor vs. ceiling” approach, and jurisdictional variances can create confusion for providers. In certain scenarios, state regulations may be more lenient than federal mandates, however, providers must adhere to the stricter standard to avoid non-compliance (Case, Court, Year).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### B. Enforcement and Penalties\n",
      "\n",
      "Regulatory bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and SAMHSA, closely monitor compliance with telehealth regulations. Common pitfalls that attract enforcement actions include inadequate documentation of informed consent, failure to secure telehealth communications in accordance with HIPAA, and discrepancies in licensure verification. Penalties can range from fines to suspension of telehealth privileges, necessitating robust internal controls and compliance training.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### C. Best Practice Controls\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these risks, healthcare providers should implement rigorous compliance protocols, including regular audits, comprehensive training for staff, and detailed contingency planning for technological failures. By adopting industry best practices, providers can minimize liability and enhance the quality of tele-behavioral health services.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Comparative Analysis: Jurisdictional Variations\n",
      "\n",
      "While New York has made significant strides in tele-behavioral health, a comparative perspective with other states—such as California, Texas, and Florida—highlights key differences in regulatory approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **California:** Emphasizes interoperability and standardized guidelines for digital health platforms, though similar licensing challenges persist.\n",
      "- **Texas:** Demonstrates a strong focus on telehealth expansion with less stringent licensure requirements across state lines, balanced by rigorous documentation protocols.\n",
      "- **Florida:** Offers robust telehealth coverage for Medicaid but faces challenges related to reimbursement and technological adoption in rural areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such comparisons underscore the need for New York providers to remain agile and informed regarding both intra-state and interstate regulatory evolutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. Future Directions and Regulatory Evolution\n",
      "\n",
      "The telehealth landscape is dynamic, with significant regulatory evolution on the horizon. New York’s recent policy shifts—such as the removal of initial in-person visit requirements for certain behavioral health services and enhanced telehealth access for controlled substance prescriptions—pave the way for future developments (nysdental.org, 2025). Providers should anticipate adjustments as federal guidelines catch up with state innovations, particularly in relation to telehealth prescribing rules and digital data privacy measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the anticipated enhancements in New York’s telehealth infrastructure signal an increasing shift toward the normalization of remote care. As new legislation such as the NY HIPA comes into effect, providers will need to adapt their practices to cultivate greater data security, heightened transparency, and improved interoperability between digital platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, telehealth for behavioral health in New York presents both expansive opportunities and considerable limitations. The regulatory framework is characterized by an intricate interplay between federal mandates—such as HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, and DEA guidelines—and state-specific requirements from agencies including OMH and NYSDOH. The following key points emerge from this analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The necessity for robust privacy and security protocols under HIPAA and the emerging NY HIPA remains paramount.\n",
      "- Licensing challenges—especially for out-of-state providers—continue to constrain the expansion of tele-behavioral health networks.\n",
      "- Reimbursement variability for Medicaid and private insurance, coupled with administrative demands, requires diligent documentation and compliance.\n",
      "- Technological and socioeconomic barriers, particularly in rural areas, necessitate targeted interventions to improve access to care.\n",
      "- The evolving regulatory landscape demands that providers maintain proactive risk management strategies and encourage continuous compliance training.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings offer essential guidance for behavioral health executives and compliance officers.

    "## Full Report\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Regulatory Framework and Policy Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Telehealth in New York State is governed by a complex matrix of federal and state regulations, designed to ensure safe, secure, and efficient delivery of healthcare services. At the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets the benchmark for privacy and security of patient information during electronic communications (HIPAA, 45 CFR Parts 160/164, 2003). In addition, the Ryan Haight Act and the DEA’s evolving telemedicine policies dictate requirements for the prescription of controlled substances in telehealth contexts. Furthermore, specialized rules such as 42 CFR Part 2 protect the confidentiality of substance use disorder treatment records.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the state level, New York has tailored these requirements to accommodate the nuances of behavioral health delivery. New York State Medicaid provides explicit guidelines for telehealth services, including the acceptance of both audio-visual and audio-only modalities when appropriate (health.ny.gov, 2023). The Office of Mental Health (OMH) further requires that providers obtain written approval and submit detailed plans prior to delivering telehealth services, ensuring that confidentiality, medical appropriateness, and informed consent are maintained (omh.ny.gov, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, recent initiatives by Governor Hochul anticipate improvements in behavioral health access by mandating that health insurance plans offer outpatient behavioral health appointments within 10 business days, while also requiring accurate, up-to-date directories of in-network telehealth providers (governor.ny.gov, 2025). Such measures underscore the commitment to not only modernizing service delivery but also safeguarding patient rights and provider responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Telehealth Modalities in Behavioral Health\n",
    "\n",
    "The regulation of tele-behavioral health in New York distinguishes between several service modalities: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio-Visual Services:** These are the preferred platforms for delivering robust, interactive care. Providers are expected to leverage video conferencing technologies that ensure real-time communication and visual assessment when necessary. Synergy between patient and provider is crucial, particularly in mental health settings, where non-verbal cues play a significant role.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio-Only Services:** Recognizing the barriers faced by some patients, New York supports the use of audio-only modalities. However, this option is strictly available under circumstances where audio-visual services are unavailable or where patient preference dictates. Providers must document the rationale behind opting for audio-only services, ensuring that clinical appropriateness is maintained (omh.ny.gov, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation and Consent:** Regardless of the modality, obtaining informed consent is a critical component. Providers must thoroughly explain the benefits, limitations, and potential risks associated with telehealth services, while documenting consent in the patient’s medical records. This measure not only complies with legal requirements but also reinforces patient engagement and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Federal and State Compliance Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Privacy and Security Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "HIPAA remains the cornerstone of privacy protection in telehealth communications. All telehealth platforms used in New York must comply with HIPAA’s guidelines to ensure the secure storage and transmission of patient data (telehealth.hhs.gov, 2020). Additionally, the forthcoming New York Health Information Privacy Act (NY HIPA) is designed to impose even stricter controls over digital health data, including explicit consent mechanisms for the processing of health information (foley.com, 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Licensing and Scope of Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant limitation in tele-behavioral health services is the necessity for providers to be licensed in New York. This requirement applies to both in-state and out-of-state practitioners providing care remotely. Out-of-state providers seeking to offer telehealth services must obtain a New York license, highlighting a barrier to increasing provider networks and enhancing access (op.nysed.gov, 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Controlled Substances and Telehealth\n",
    "\n",
    "The prescription of controlled substances via telehealth poses another layer of regulatory complexity. New York State has, under regulated circumstances, permitted the prescription of controlled substances via telemedicine, contingent upon meeting specific criteria such as recent in-person evaluations or emergency exceptions (nixonpeabody.com, 2025). Providers must adhere to both NYSDOH guidelines and federal DEA rules to navigate this area without incurring compliance risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Practical Considerations and Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Technological Barriers\n",
    "\n",
    "The adoption of telehealth is not uniform across New York. In rural areas, limited broadband access, inadequate digital literacy, and the unavailability of necessary devices pose significant challenges. These technological hurdles contribute to disparities in access to tele-behavioral health services and require targeted policy interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Reimbursement and Insurance Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Another practical consideration involves reimbursement policies. Medicaid in New York covers telehealth services under specific conditions. However, discrepancies remain among private insurers regarding coverage for tele-behavioral services. The New York State Department of Financial Services provides guidance to navigate insurance variability, but providers must remain alert to potential delays or denials in reimbursement if documentation and service criteria are not strictly followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Provider Workflows and Liability\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating telehealth into established clinical workflows can disrupt traditional practices. Providers often cite concerns over maintaining therapeutic rapport, managing technical failures, and ensuring that telehealth sessions meet the standards of in-person care. Additionally, the administrative burden of documenting rationales for telehealth use—including exceptions for certain modalities—can lead to errors if not meticulously managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Risk Analysis and Enforcement Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Interplay of Federal and State Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "A central challenge in the tele-behavioral healthcare realm is the intersection of federal and state regulations. Issues such as pre-emption, the “floor vs. ceiling” approach, and jurisdictional variances can create confusion for providers. In certain scenarios, state regulations may be more lenient than federal mandates, however, providers must adhere to the stricter standard to avoid non-compliance (Case, Court, Year).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Enforcement and Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and SAMHSA, closely monitor compliance with telehealth regulations. Common pitfalls that attract enforcement actions include inadequate documentation of informed consent, failure to secure telehealth communications in accordance with HIPAA, and discrepancies in licensure verification. Penalties can range from fines to suspension of telehealth privileges, necessitating robust internal controls and compliance training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Best Practice Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these risks, healthcare providers should implement rigorous compliance protocols, including regular audits, comprehensive training for staff, and detailed contingency planning for technological failures. By adopting industry best practices, providers can minimize liability and enhance the quality of tele-behavioral health services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Comparative Analysis: Jurisdictional Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "While New York has made significant strides in tele-behavioral health, a comparative perspective with other states—such as California, Texas, and Florida—highlights key differences in regulatory approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **California:** Emphasizes interoperability and standardized guidelines for digital health platforms, though similar licensing challenges persist.\n",
    "- **Texas:** Demonstrates a strong focus on telehealth expansion with less stringent licensure requirements across state lines, balanced by rigorous documentation protocols.\n",
    "- **Florida:** Offers robust telehealth coverage for Medicaid but faces challenges related to reimbursement and technological adoption in rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such comparisons underscore the need for New York providers to remain agile and informed regarding both intra-state and interstate regulatory evolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Future Directions and Regulatory Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The telehealth landscape is dynamic, with significant regulatory evolution on the horizon. New York’s recent policy shifts—such as the removal of initial in-person visit requirements for certain behavioral health services and enhanced telehealth access for controlled substance prescriptions—pave the way for future developments (nysdental.org, 2025). Providers should anticipate adjustments as federal guidelines catch up with state innovations, particularly in relation to telehealth prescribing rules and digital data privacy measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the anticipated enhancements in New York’s telehealth infrastructure signal an increasing shift toward the normalization of remote care. As new legislation such as the NY HIPA comes into effect, providers will need to adapt their practices to cultivate greater data security, heightened transparency, and improved interoperability between digital platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, telehealth for behavioral health in New York presents both expansive opportunities and considerable limitations. The regulatory framework is characterized by an intricate interplay between federal mandates—such as HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, and DEA guidelines—and state-specific requirements from agencies including OMH and NYSDOH.

    "## Core Concepts and Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of the SDK are **agents**—intelligent entities that encapsulate a specific set of instructions and tools. Each agent is built on top of a large language model and can be customized with its own personality, domain expertise, and operational directives. For example, a \"Math Tutor\" agent could be designed to solve math problems by explaining each step clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key elements of an agent include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instructions:** Specific guidelines that shape the agent's responses and behavior in the context of its designated role.\n",
    "- **Tools:** Predefined or dynamically integrated tools that the agent can leverage to access external resources (e.g., web search or file search functionalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique feature introduced by the SDK is the concept of **handoffs**. Handoffs allow agents to delegate tasks to one another based on expertise and contextual needs. This orchestration paves the way for sophisticated workflows where multiple agents work in tandem, each contributing its specialized capabilities to complete a complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guardrails\n",
