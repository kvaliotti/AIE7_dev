        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "1. Memory is constrained, so the more data we have, the more memory we'll need, which is a problem for scaling. Disk caching is easier to scale and also persistent, but it may significantly reduce the speed benefit. Yet, if we are primarily concerned about costs, disk caching is a good option. \n",
        "2. From what I understand, there is currently no cache invalidation other than restart (memory is not persistent) or when memory overflows. We can: a) introduce TTL; b) introduce TTL that increases TTL value exponentially for requests that are received often; c) invalidate on document update.\n",
        "3. Not sure about concurrency, but writing to memory in parallel may result in issues with data quality, IIRC.\n",
        "4. Depending on the use case and the system, cache size may become too big and consume all memory (or disk, which is less likely I guess). Cache size limits should solve this. \n",
        "5. Cold start... I'm struggling to fully appreciate the caching use case because I don't see any relevant to me, but we can seed cache with documents that are most likely to be retrieved. "

Your monthly payment under the standard plan may be higher than it would be under the other plans because your loans will be repaid in the shortest time. For that reason, having a 10-year limit on repayment, you may pay the least interest. [...] (see link by expanding NSLDS accordion below). The Direct PLUS Loan Program for parents offers three repayment plans-standard, extended, and graduated-that are designed to meet the different needs of individual borrowers. The terms differ between the repayment programs, but generally borrowers will have 10 to 25 years to repay a loan.  A PLUS Loan made to the parent cannot be transferred to the student. The parent is responsible for repaying the PLUS Loan. [...] Graduate PLUS Loans- GRAD PLUS loans are credit-based, available to Graduate students, and require a separate application and MPN. There are several repayment plans that are designed to meet the different needs of individual borrowers.

        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "1. Simple agent is pretty straightforward, and relies on the provided context as is. Helpful agent, as evident from the example above, evaluates whether the response it generates is helpful, and if not, seeks information with which to answer. \n",
        " - Helpful agent is great when some answer is better than no answer because it will chase information to provide something helpful, but in the pursuit of helpfulness the agent may come up with an unfit answer if it wasn't present in RAG, for example, when the question targets a specific knowledge base. \n",
        "2. Helpful agent will answer with bigger latency because it does additional action of checking whether the response was helpful. If it wasn't, it will fully rerun the cycle. Potentially, this leads to explosion in latency, even though we prevent infinite cycles. \n",
        " - It will also run up costs for us due to increased number of cycles per each query. Given the fact that the helpful agent will chase information to provide some answer, I'd be on the lookout for: a) hallucination rate (it may increase due to it); b) latency & cost (discussed).\n",
        "3. Under the high concurrent load Simple Agent will perform better because there is less to perform, which means end-to-end execution will be faster, and we'll have less parallel executions of it. \n",
        " - Not sure about caching, but it seems to be similar between two agents. The only difference may be in helpful agent where lack of persistent caching will lead to longer execution cycles in cases where we don't have a document to retrieve. \n",
        " - Rate limiting: similar basic rate limits to prevent spam; however, helpful agent needs a circuit breaker based on number of executed cycles or actions performed, e.g., 10 as it was by default for this agent. "

        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
